# About

This is the front-end application of my Final Year Project for Course Recommender System.

This website will be where users mainly use the application and the API server takes care of making recommendations.

Made using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Deployment

Deployed as a dockerized app alongside the API server within a Digital Ocean's droplet.
